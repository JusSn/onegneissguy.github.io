# Welcome to my GitHub page.

I post about electronics and software projects that I work on in my daily life. I'll typically write about electronics like  environmental sensors, microcomputers (ala Raspberri Pi and Arduino) and remote control and autonomous (drones) planes, helicopters and quadcopters.   

I'll also post about my forays into data science using Python and R.
