My name is John Franco Saraceno. I'm a trained scientist and amateur maker.

I'm from the San Francisco Bay area and moved up to Sacramento to attend college in 2005. I have a B.S. in Geology from U.C. Davis and a M.S. in Geology from Sacramento State. I'm a hydrologist with the [U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov) and work with water quality sensors.

I love finding out how things work by tearing them down (and sometimes putting them back together again...). Recently, I've taken up developing low-cost Arduino based sensor platforms. I also develop open source data visualization and analysis packages in Python. Check out some of software projects on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/onegneissguy) if you would like to know more about my projects or contribute to make them better. 

When time permits, I fly R/C UAV's, tinker in my electronics shop or more often than not, go on a jog with my [Catahoula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catahoula_Cur) on the American River.
