My name is John Franco Saraceno and I'm a trained scientist and amateur maker.

I'm from the San Francisco Bay area and moved up to the Sacramento area to attend college in 2005. I have a B.S. in Geology from U.C. Davis and a M.S. in Geology from Sacramento State. I'm a hydrologist with the [U.S. Geological Survey](www.usgs.gov) and work to develop and improve the performance of water quality sensors.

I love finding out how things work by tearing them down and sometimes putting them back together again...Recently, I've taken up developing low-cost Arduino based sensor measurement and logging platforms as well as open source data visualization and analysis packages for government databases in Python. Check out my [code](www.github.com/onegneissguy) on GitHub if you would like to know more about my projects. 

When time permits, I fly R/C UAV's, go camping or more often than not, go on a jog wth my [Catahoula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catahoula_Cur) on the American River. 

I believe the only real thing in life that we can control is our attitude so I'm always working to improve my attitude. I'll be the first to admit that I fall short of this goal many a days.
