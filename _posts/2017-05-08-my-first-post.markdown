Welcome to my blog. I hope to use this blog to post my adventures in software development.
As I develop solutions to problems that I encounter in data wrangling and analyis, I'll post 
them here to share with the community.
The nice thing about this blog is that supports code snippets.
For example here's a Ruby code snippet:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
