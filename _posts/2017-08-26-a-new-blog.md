Update Me! Use this as your template for blog posts. Just change the title and the content here and it will show up on your main page. The main page shows your five most recent posts (and once you put some pictures in the posts we can add a link to your favorite one in there so it shows up on the main page as well)

Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
